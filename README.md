# MUTE: Multi User Text Editor

Edit documents collaboratively in real-time with hundreds of users on the same document, even with a light server. MUTE implements a CRDT-based consistency algorithm for large scale peer-to-peer collaboration: [LogootSplit](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-structs#ref-1). This algorithm can be seen as an extension for variable-sized elements (e.g. strings) of one of the basic CRDT algorithms for unit elements (e.g. characters).

You can check:

- our live demonstration server at <https://mutehost.loria.fr>
- or quickstart MUTE on your machine via `npm start` and then access it on <http://localhost:4200>

## :package: Deployment

MUTE runs in the browser, which means that modifications are sent directly to your peers without any intermediary server. However the peer-to-peer technology requires a few servers for discovery and signaling. A complete MUTE instance relies on the following servers:

- your web server serving the MUTE static files over HTTPS
- a WebSocket signaling server which is mandatory in order to establish a connection between two users
- an (optional but highly recommended) [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) server to relay messages in case WebRTC is blocked on a user's network

MUTE comes with a default set of STUN servers configured for WebRTC.

Proceed with the following steps:

1.  Deploy the signaling server ([how to](https://github.com/coast-team/sigver))
2.  Build MUTE static files ([how to](https://github.com/coast-team/mute/wiki/Before-building))
3.  Serve static files

> TIP: If you serve MUTE via HTTPS, the Signaling server should also be secure, i. e. available via `wss` protocol.
>
> TIP: You may find a full NGINX configuration example in the `conf` folder

## :book: Documentation

- [Demo deployment on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/coast-team/mute/wiki/Deploy:-Raspberry-Pi)
- [Production deployment with NGINX on Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/coast-team/mute/wiki/Deploy:-Production)

## :bar_chart: Benchmark

> NOTE: more automated/replicable benchmarks will be added in the future

Compared to existing web-based collaborative text editing tools, MUTE does not require a powerful central server since the server is not performing any computation. You can even work offline and reconnect later without losing your changes.

In our experience, performance drops significantly after reaching tens of users on a document on centralized platforms. MUTEÂ doesn't process changes server-side, allowing much larger groups to collaboratively edit a document.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Architecture

MUTE relies on other libraries we develop, which you can reuse in your projects:

- [@coast-team/mute-core](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-core): core component ensuring typical document-editing operations are done in an orderly fashion
- [@coast-team/mute-structs](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-structs): an implementation of the [LogootSplit](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-structs#ref-1) CRDT algorithm
- [@coast-team/mute-crypto](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-crypto): a group cryptographic key agreement implementation using [Burmester and Desmedt's algorithm](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-crypto)
- [@coast-team/mute-auth-proxy](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-auth-proxy): assign public/private key pairs to autenticated users, for later use in mute-crypto

MUTE also has a pluggable system of services called *Bots*. They can act like peers in documents to provide
services:

- [@coast-team/mute-bot-storage](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-bot-storage): stores documents for others when you are offline

MUTE exchanges messages by default over WebRTC via:

- [netflux](https://github.com/coast-team/netflux): peer-to-peer browser communication layer
- [sigver](https://github.com/coast-team/sigver): signaling for WebRTC

In the future, any communication layer could be used, like [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) which we support already for increased reliability!

One of the best ways to contribute to MUTE is to help these libraries!
